## Project Roadmap & Development Timeline

### Completed Steps

#### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Completed)
- [x] Initial project setup with Electron
- [x] Package.json configuration with dependencies
- [x] Windows XP theme styling basics
- [x] Basic main process implementation

#### Phase 2: UI Components & Resource Limiters (Completed)
- [x] Resource Monitor Component (`src/ui/components/resource-monitor.js`)
  - Real-time monitoring of CPU, RAM, and network usage
  - Visual display with meters and controls
  - IPC integration with main process

- [x] Sound Manager Component (`src/ui/components/sound-manager.js`)
  - Multiple sound themes support
  - Volume control and theme switching
  - Sound settings dialog UI

- [x] Plugin System (`src/plugins/plugin-loader.js`)
  - Plugin directory scanning
  - Loading, enabling, disabling plugins
  - Sandboxed plugin API with permissions

- [x] Sample Weather Plugin
  - Plugin manifest with metadata and permissions
  - Main.js with mock weather data and forecasting
  - Weather sidebar UI with Windows XP styling
  - Weather toolbar component with notifications

#### Phase 3: Resource Limiters Implementation (Completed)
- [x] Network Throttler Module (`src/limiters/network-throttler.js`)
  - HTTP/HTTPS proxy for bandwidth control
  - Download/upload speed limiting
  - Network conditions simulation
  - Domain exclusion support

- [x] CPU Limiter Module (`src/limiters/cpu-limiter.js`)
  - Real-time CPU monitoring
  - Process priority control
  - Intelligent throttling algorithm
  - Cross-platform implementation

- [x] Memory Limiter Module (`src/limiters/memory-limiter.js`)
  - Advanced memory management
  - Per-tab memory limiting
  - Garbage collection optimization
  - Memory leak detection

- [x] Python Launcher Script (`run_browser.py`)
  - Cross-platform launcher
  - Virtual environment setup
  - Node.js dependency management
  - Ollama configuration

### Current Step

#### Resource Limiter IPC Integration (Completed)
- [x] Renderer Process Integration
  - BrowserIntegration module import and initialization
  - Resource Limiter Settings Panel UI integration
  - Status bar indicators for resource usage
  - Legacy dialog replacement with modern panel

- [x] Preload Script Enhancements
  - Secure IPC channels for limiter components
  - Context-isolated communication implementation
  - Comprehensive API exposure for resource management

- [x] Main Process IPC Handlers (LimiterManager)
  - Custom profiles management implementation
  - Advanced settings configuration support
  - Diagnostics and maintenance functions
  - Settings panel visibility control
  - Enhanced event communication system

We are now ready to proceed with testing the Resource Limiter integration across platforms and implementing the plugin management UI.

  - Distribution channel setup

## Immediate Action Items

1. Complete the main browser UI integration with all components
2. Implement the tabbed browsing interface with XP styling
3. Connect resource limiters to the UI controls
4. Create configuration panel for resource limits
5. Integrate plugin system with the main browser interface
6. Test all components for cross-platform compatibility
7. Implement plugin management UI

## Known Issues & Blockers

1. Network throttling proxy needs integration with Electron's session
2. Plugin development mode requires file watchers implementation
3. Need to acquire sound assets for different sound themes
4. Weather plugin requires real API integration (currently using mock data)
5. Resource limiters need fine-tuning for edge cases
